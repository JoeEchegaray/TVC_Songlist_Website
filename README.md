# TVC_Songlist_Website
Songlist Web App Project


#History
This is a website that I had created for a music content creator "TVC" to create an "Approved" Songlist with some search functionality for stream moderators to quickly identify and screen songs and leave comments

#Goal
I would like to turn this into a Web Based Application with Twitch API Integration for Authentication and Chat Interaction, and to turn this into a full replacement for the current method used in her stream for Song Queue Screening.

#Initial Tasks/Issues
    Remove paid JS codelets for search functionality and rewrite those functions to be natively based and reduce project costs.

    Remove all references to the Webflow CMS and rewrite that using the Database API currently being used for content management (Currently using Airtable, looking at cheaper options)
